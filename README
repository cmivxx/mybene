#  MyBenefits WordPress Plugin  #
#################################

This is a plugin I created to work as a MyBenefits client program for WordPress to let clients create 
individual, password-protected client sections to distribute secured documents.  It's a very basic attempt
such, but it accomplished the needed result.

## TODO
   - Add in multi-file uploading
   - Allow for sorting/searching of clients list
   - Remove unneeded fields from client info
   - Add in draggable order for page order
   - Add in checks to support SSL coverage for pages

## Installation
   1) Upload folder to *site-root*/wp-content/plugins/
   2) Change permissions to the /client-files/ folder to 744
   3) COPY both files from /template-files/ to the template folder for template of site.
      3a) customize the template files to fit/match design layout of template if needed.
